- 👋 Hi, I’m @vernondacosta. I'm a technical writer but also tipping my toe into web development.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use GitHub because I'm an absolute newbie and I'd love to learn about how I can collaborate with teams on projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects as a technical writer and, eventually, a web developer.
- 📫 You can reach me at vernon.dacosta@gmail.com
